# Return the Sum of Two Numbers

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

## Examples
```
sum(3, 2) ➞ 5

sum(-3, -6) ➞ -9

sum(7, 3) ➞ 10
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command ```npm test -- sum.test.js``` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to ```return``` the result.
- If you get stuck, look at the ```sum.test.js``` file for what the tests may look like.
