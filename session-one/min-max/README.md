# Find the Smallest and Biggest Numbers

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

## Examples
```
minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 5]

minMax([2334454, 5]) ➞ [5, 2334454]

minMax([1]) ➞ [1, 1]
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command ```npm test -- minMax.test.js``` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to ```return``` the result.
- All test arrays will have at least one element and are valid.
- If you get stuck, look at the ```minMax.test.js``` file for what the tests may look like.
