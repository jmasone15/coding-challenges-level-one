# Return the First Element in an Array

Create a function that takes an array containing only numbers and return the first element.

## Examples
```
getFirstValue([1, 2, 3]) ➞ 1

getFirstValue([80, 5, 100]) ➞ 80

getFirstValue([-500, 0, 50]) ➞ -500
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command ```npm test -- first.test.js``` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to ```return``` the result.
- How do we ```index``` the first element in an array?
- If you get stuck, look at the ```first.test.js``` file for what the tests may look like.
