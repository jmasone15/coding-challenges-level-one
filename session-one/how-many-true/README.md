# How Many are True?

Create a function which returns the number of ```true``` values there are in an array.

## Examples
```
howManyTrue([true, false, false, true, false]) ➞ 2

howManyTrue([false, false, false, false]) ➞ 0

howManyTrue([true, false]) ➞ 1
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command ```npm test -- howMany.test.js``` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to ```return``` the result.
- All array items are of the type boolean (```true``` or ```false```).
- If you get stuck, look at the ```howMany.test.js``` file for what the tests may look like.
