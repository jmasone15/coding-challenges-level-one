# Sum of Multiplication

Given a number, return the total sum of that number multiplied by every number between 1 and 10.

## Examples
```
multiSum(1) ➞ 55
// 1 x 1 + 1 x 2 + 1 x 3 ...... 1 x 9 + 1 x 10 = 55

multiSum(6) ➞ 330

multiSum(10) ➞ 550
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command `npm test -- multi-sum.test.js` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to `return` the result.
- If you get stuck, look at the `multi-sum.test.js` file for what the tests may look like.
- Can you solve this challenge using recursion?
