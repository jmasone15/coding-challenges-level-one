# Number Split

Given a number, return an array containing the two halves of the number. If the number is odd, make the **rightmost number higher.**

## Examples
```
numberSplit(4) ➞ [2, 2]

numberSplit(11) ➞ [5, 6]

numberSplit(-10) ➞ [-5, -5]
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command `npm test -- number-split.test.js` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to `return` the result.
- If you get stuck, look at the `number-split.test.js` file for what the tests may look like.
- How can you determine if a number is odd or even?
