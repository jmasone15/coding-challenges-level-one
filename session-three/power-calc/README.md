# Power Calculator

Create a function that takes `voltage` and `current` and returns the calculated power.

## Examples
```
circuitPower(230, 10) ➞ 2300

circuitPower(110, 3) ➞ 330

circuitPower(480, 20) ➞ 9600
```

## Testing
Once you think you have the correct solution, open your terminal and use the command `npm test -- power-calc.test.js` to run the necessary tests.

## Notes
- Don't forget to `return` the result.
- If you get stuck, look at the `power-calc.test.js` file for what the tests may look like.
- The description doesn't tell you exactly what to do, how can you determine how to solve this challenge?
